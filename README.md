# Introduction-to-neural-networks
This is a brief, high-level introduction to neural networks that I crafted for a presentation at NASA. 

Download the figures and the Jupyter Notebook script to step through explanations of neural network architecture and to develop an intuition for their operation. 

Links to several other useful resources are provided and can serve as specific direction for your next steps to understanding and using neural networks.
